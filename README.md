# TicTacToe
Self Tic-Tac-Toe project.
The base Tic-Tac-Toe file is playable in a terminal but only with two players.
To play the Pygame Tic-Tac-Toe version you just run pygameTicTacToe.py and then you can choose the number of players, if its 0 or 1 then it will ask you what difficulty you want, if the number of players is also 1 then it will ask you what player you want to be.
This game has been altered to my girlfriends request in which I have made her cat Taco the X's and my cat Oreo the O's, X's go first.
I have implemented an AI which uses the Minimax algorithm when you choose hard mode and it just chooses a vaild move at random when you choose easy mode.
